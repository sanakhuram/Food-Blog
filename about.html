                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  One of our earliest memories is baking cookies with our grandmother. The smell of fresh cookies still brings back those warm, happy moments. It was her passion for cooking that sparked our own love for the kitchen.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Another unforgettable experience was our trip to Italy, where we learned the art of making authentic pasta from a local chef. It was a life-changing moment that deepened our appreciation for culinary traditions.
